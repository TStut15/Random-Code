# Random-Code
I randomly decided to move some of my code over to github
## Codes
### MSet Codes
The MSet Codes are code I created to create mandelbrot sets.
### Newton.f90
Code I created to calculate zeros with Newtons method.
### DecToHex.f90
Writes out Hex as ascii characters from a given Dec input.
### DecToHexToFile.90
Started out as a test of the char() function and turned into a program that writes dec inputs as hex bytes in a file.
