# Random-Code
I randomly decided to move some of my code over to github
## Codes
### MSet
The MSet Codes are code I created to create mandelbrot sets. The MATLAB code is slower, but takes advantage of the display capibilities of MATLAB. The Fortran code is Much faster but can only output into a PGM image.
### Newton
Code I created to calculate zeros with Newtons method
